Code description: The HTML5 structure used in this project is clear and semantic. The page is divided into a main part with sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact details, a navigation bar with anchor links, and a header with the portfolio title. A footer for branding completes the arrangement. The use of semantic elements enhances the code's readability, accessibility, and maintainability.

Skills learned: This project taught me how to use semantic HTML5 components like header, nav, main, section, and footer to organize a webpage. I became more adept at using lists and images correctly, dividing text into distinct sections, and building in-page navigation with anchor links. I also gained a better understanding of the value of clear, understandable markup and laying a strong foundation before incorporating styling or interactivity thanks to this project.
